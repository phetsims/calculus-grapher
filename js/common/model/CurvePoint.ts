/**
 * CurvePoint is a single mutable point of a Curve at a given x-value.
 * Each CurvePoint contains the following information:
 *   - The corresponding y-value and type of the Point.
 *   - All of its previously 'saved' states. When the user finishes manipulating the TransformedCurve, the state of
 *     CurvePoint in the TransformedCurve is saved.
 *
 * For the 'Calculus Grapher' simulation, CurvePoints are used inside of Curve (and its subclasses) to partition the curve
 * into a finite number of close points that map out the general shape and curvature. CurvePoints are created
 * at the start of the sim and are mutated when the Curve changes. CurvePoints are never disposed.
