/**
 * Curve is the base class for a single 'curve' that appears in the 'Calculus Grapher' simulation. It provides
 * functionality that is common to all types of curves, and is intended to be sub-classed for type-specific features.
 *
 * Curves are modeled by segmenting the curve into a finite number of CurvePoints that are close together and map out
 * their y-values to the shape of a function. Adjacent CurvePoints are considered to be infinitesimally close
 * enough for derivative and integral computations and are considered to cover 'every' x-value within its domain.
 *
 * Responsibilities are:
 *   - Create an array of CurvePoints for the Curve.
 *   - Create convenience methods to reference and mutate CurvePoints at a given x-value.
 *   - Provide other convenience methods to set the initial value of the curve points.
 *
 * For the 'Calculus Grapher' sim, the same Curves instances are used throughout the lifetime of the simulation, so no
 * dispose method is necessary. An overview for the class hierarchy of Curves is given in
 * https://github.com/phetsims/calculus-grapher/blob/main/doc/implementation-notes.md
