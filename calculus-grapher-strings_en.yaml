                        Move vertical line horizontally to change {$variable} value and explore relationship between
                        cumulative net signed area under f up to current {$variable} value. Shaded area is bounded by
                        {$variable} axis and f curve. Vertical line passes through all graphs at same {$variable} value.
                        Information provides current {$variable} value, value of integral up to {$variable}, and
                        net signed area under f curve.
